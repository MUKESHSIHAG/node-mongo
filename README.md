# this is simple node module
In this module node module is connected to mongo server
coonecting to mongo server run your server by going in appropriate folder and in terminal type the command  
$ mongod --dbpath=data --bind_ip 127.0.0.1
now, your server is up and running.
now type npm start and see the result in terminal.

this clears my concepts, how to connect with mongo server which is very easy.
